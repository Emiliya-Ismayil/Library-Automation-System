Library Automation System 


I have prepared a project that can handle all the needs of a library. It includes, borrowing books, bring back, add book,delete book, book updating and some control methods for librarians.
The project has two interfaces: administrator and user.The administrator adds books and user additions to the system, the user can also take the books entrusted through the system.
This project is made with using C# Programming Language and MSSQL as a database.
